An adaptive full-stack web developer wants to always learn and improve himself, socializing and adapting to the organization's environment. striving to achieve the goals and pursue the dream in life. All in my portfolio was made from the scratch, a part from that is come from the ideas of other developer and enhance it with other design and animation.
